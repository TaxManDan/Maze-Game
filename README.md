# Overview

This is a simple maze game where the user controls a circle and tries to make it to the green square at the end.

This software was made to combine my abilities of making gui and logic that controls that gui into one tangible project.

# Development Environment

I used pycharm to create this software along with photopea for making maze designs.

This program was made in python using the arcade library.
